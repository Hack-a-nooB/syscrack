# Be a hacker in a virtual internet

Syscrack is an online hacking simulator inspired by incremental PHP based web-games such as Slavehack and
hacker experience. A major goal of Syscrack is to allow for a moddable experience of which users with little to
no prior programming knownledge can create new game mechanics with ease. 

Another major goal of Syscrack is to be really fun. The game is an open sandbox environment based on the ip address
and hacking into computers. Users may install viruses onto other players machines for profit. Because of the
dynamic nature of Syscrack there is a large selection of tools and mechanics for the user to have fun with.

This project has been actively developed since 2016 by Lewis Lancaster. We use FlightPHP for our microframework
and we also use Laravel's database components, as well as PHPMailer for our email related tasks and we also both the
Google and Facebook SDK's from respective companies. Most of Syscrack is written from scratch over the combined efforts of
4 years.

## Installation

We currently do not support your endevour to install Syscrack before we've put out the correct tools to do so. Right now
most of the focus is on things like testing and implementing crucial features. We will be releasing a
detailed guide however in the future.

For now, if you are adament on setting up your own Syscrack. You will need go to www.flightphp.com and create a
rewrite rule for your server. Your Syscrack installation will not work otherwise as this is crucial.

Syscrack can also be launched in terminal mode by running the following command in Syscracks root directory.

`
php execute.php
`

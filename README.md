# Whats going on here?

Hello! Its been a long and quite eventful two years. I'm back on Syscrack for the foreseeable future now as I've found my self in the position again to work on this project full time. With my return comes big changes to Syscrack as a whole, as secretly in my two years of silence, I've been finetuning my skills with the PHP Language as well as getting deep into cloud hosting environments and contiunous integration environments that I'd like to take advantage of.

Bottom line is, the code which currently supports the alpha prototype is bad. Its really bad. Looking back after a few years away, trying to work with the current prototype as it is was a frustrating and quite confusing experience. Errors seemingly popped up randomly even when I made the smallest changes. This means right now development is very slow and I'm "walking on egg shells" with most of my edits.

I plan on bringing two big updates to this current prototype, these updates will tie up a few loose ends in the current engine which will allow a continuous game of Syscrack to be played out indefinately while I work on the brand new PHP 7.3 rewrite on a completely new framework written from scratch specifically for Syscrack and deals with most of the issues I came across while working on this version. 

## So, what now?

I don't suggest attempting to host this version your self right now. Because of the state of this repo, I'm currently not even considering writing detailed installation guides for anything other than an XAMPP Windows 10 environment. Its not a clean install right now and something will most probably go wrong. 

But do not fear! I will be frequently posting patches and small fixes and you will eventually be able to drag and drop this repo into your webservers root directory and set up a new syscrack installation as normal. Bundled with one of these patches will be instructions on how to set up Syscrack for your Windows environment. But please have patience.

## More updates coming soon & our official syscrack host to follow

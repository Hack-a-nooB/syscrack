        <p>
            Nineteen Eighty-Four, often published as 1984, is a dystopian novel published in 1949 by English author
            George Orwell.[1][2] The novel is set in Airstrip One (formerly known as Great Britain), a province of the
            superstate Oceania in a world of perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, and public
            manipulation. The superstate and its residents are dictated to by a political regime euphemistically named
            English Socialism, shortened to "Ingsoc" in Newspeak, the government's invented language. The superstate is
            under the control of the privileged elite of the Inner Party, a party and government that persecutes
            individualism and independent thinking as "thoughtcrime", which is enforced by the "Thought Police".[3]
